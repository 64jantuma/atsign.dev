We created the @dev Program to foster a new generation of privacy-respecting, surveillance-free mobile apps developed on the @protocol, and to help developers create a hassle-free revenue stream. To ensure that the apps we promote are of the highest quality, we’ve created the @certificaion process. Certified apps will earn our @certified badge and be eligible to join @affiliates.
