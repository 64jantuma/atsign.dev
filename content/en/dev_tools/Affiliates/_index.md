## How Referrals Work
True to our mission, we do not track people using our site, which is how most referral programs operate. Instead, we use the following methods to discover your referrals and give you credit:
 
### New @ signs Paired With Your App
After someone downloads your app, they must pair an @sign with it so they can use it. New @signs aren’t functional until they’ve been activated by the owner. The last step for @sign activation is to pair the new @sign with an app. Whenever someone pairs their new, paid @sign with your app, you’ll receive referral credit. (We’ll talk more about this on our call when you’re ready to start earning commissions. If you’ve got questions in the meantime, feel free to ask!)


### Referral Link and Code
We will provide you with a unique referral link that brings people to our site where they can get a free or paid @sign.  You can use this link on your blog or website, in your newsletter, on your social channels, and wherever you connect with your community. When someone clicks on your referral link, we’ll automagically add a unique code, connected to your account, to their shopping cart at checkout. If they purchase an @sign, you’ll receive credit. 

We will also provide you with a unique promo code. You can share it verbally (excellent for when you’re a guest on a podcast, or are speaking at an event), on printed materials, or anytime a clickable link isn’t convenient. In order to receive referral credit in these cases, people must enter your promo code in the promo box when they purchase their @sign.  

Please continue reading for important information about required disclosure and how commissions work. 


## Disclosure
Per the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) guidelines you must disclose that you will earn a commission on sales made when someone clicks on your link or enters your code at checkout.   
Your disclosure needs to be near the referral link, so you can be reasonably sure that anyone clicking through to purchase an @sign understands that you have a partnership with The @ Company. 

#### Here’s wording that you’re welcome to use. 
You can update the “I” in “...I will earn a commission…” with “we” or your company name — whatever’s the best fit.

“Disclosure: If you purchase an @sign after clicking on this link, I will earn a commission. You will never be charged any fee or incur any additional costs for being referred.”

To ensure both clarity for the consumer and compliance with this U.S. law, we will also provide disclosure on our site for anyone purchasing an @sign. 



## Earnings
When people pair their new @sign with your app, or use your referral link or code to purchase an @sign (or several!), you’ll earn a 20% commission. 

A few notes about this:

- There is no commission on free @signs.
- Regarding referral links: Commissions are assigned to the owner of the last referral link that the person making the purchase clicked.
Example: If Customer A clicks on a link provided by Developer X, and then later clicks on a link provided by Developer Y and purchases an @sign, Developer Y will receive the full commission for transactions related to Customer A. 
- Commissions will not be split or transferred. 
- Commission will not be applied retroactively.

Commissions earned in the space of each month will be finalized and approved by The @ Company on or about the 5th of the following month, and paid on or about the 15th of the month when they were approved (excluding holidays and weekends, which will be approved or paid on or about the next business day). For example, if you earn a commission on August 5th, it, along with all August commissions, would likely be approved by September 5th and paid on September 15th. 

There is a minimum payment threshold of $25 for U.S.-based participants, and $100 for those outside of the U.S. If you earn less than the minimum in a month, your earnings roll over to the following month, and will continue to do so until you reach the threshold. 

You are responsible for all taxes and reporting requirements stemming from your commission earnings. We will provide you with a statement of activity, and a U.S. Tax Form 1099 if you’re paying taxes in the U.S. and we pay you $600 or more in a calendar year. 


### Dashboard
You’ll have access to our Partner Dashboard that will display your revenue and upcoming payment information, along with reporting that shows the transaction details for all your commissions.

### Additional Guidelines

In addition to the disclosure requirement mentioned above, there are some other advertising guidelines you must follow. 

#### Referral Link and Code Best Practices:
- Please do not make any alterations to your referral link, including using URL shorteners. If it’s not exactly what we sent you, we won’t be able to credit you for your referrals. 
 Please make sure to display your disclosure statement along with your referral link, or use a verbal disclosure if you’re sharing the code in conversation.  

#### General Advertising Guidelines:
- We may offer you access to discounts, coupons, promo codes, or other promotional offers. In order to take advantage of those, you’ll need to comply with all terms and limitations that we establish in connection with any promotional offers.
- We’re solidly anti-spam. Please do not engage in any telemarketing or send any unsolicited bulk-emails, SMS, or text messages containing your referral link, code, or any marketing messages about the program. 
- Please do not alter any of The @ Company’s marketing images, text, or other materials we provide to you without our written consent and approval. Look for a resource library with images and copy coming soon! 

#### Social Media & Newsletter Advertising Guidelines: 
- If you’d like to share your referral link with your community via a newsletter or your social channels, that’s great! Please contact us for images and text suggestions to make it super easy to do so. We’re happy to work with you as schedules allow if you’d like to interview someone on the team or have help writing longer-form content for your newsletter, blog, or website. 
- Please do not reproduce content from our site or social channels without our permission.
- If you’re posting on any social platforms, you’ll need to disclose our partnership. (Always, always disclose.) Acceptable hashtag disclosures are #sponsored #ad #affiliate #paid
- Referral links may be posted on your social channels, and not on anyone else’s. Please do not post your referral link on any of The @ Company’s social channels or other properties. 
- You may not create a social media account that includes our trademark(s) in the page name and/or username. -->
