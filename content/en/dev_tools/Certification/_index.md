### What to expect in the @certification process?
- When your app is ready for user testing, email us a link to your code in GitHub at getcertified[at]atsign.com 
- Look for our approval or revision suggestions within approximately 5 business days. 



#### Here’s the criteria we use to evaluate apps:

##### Safety and People Support
- Does your app have any objectionable content?
- Does your app risk physical or psychological harm?
- Does your app provide customer care and contact info?
- Does your app use the automatic privacy compliance built into the @protocol?
##### Performance
- Is the version of your app complete?
- Has it been beta tested?
- Have you assigned accurate metadata for search?
- Does your app meet the @sign guidelines for API?
##### Business
- Does your app use surveillance-free advertising or subscriptions, if you decide to supplement your @sign commissions revenue?
- Does your app provide access to and an explanation of @sign registration for customers?
##### Design
- Is your app designed well and does it integrate the @sign UI guidelines?
- Is your app valuable and enjoyable to use?
- Does your app take advantage of the @protocol benefits?
- Does your version have the MVP of features?
##### Privacy
- Does your app only collect data on personal servers (true P2P, not on secondary servers)?
- Does your app ensure no tracking and location tracking?
- Is your app surveillance-free?
