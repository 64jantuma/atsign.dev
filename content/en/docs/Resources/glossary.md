#### @sign

The @sign is your unique digital identifier for the Privacy-First App Ecosystem. At the root level, every person, entity, and thing has its string or unique digital identity on the internet: @alice, @bmw, @device.

At [The @ Company](https://atsign.com) we are internet optimists. We believe in the internet and all it has to offer. And, we want to make the internet better. How? Well, our co-founders decided to go to the core. They developed an open-source technology at the protocol level. No more client-server thinking, no more authentication nightmares and walled gardens, no more entering the same data ad nauseam into a data center owned by somebody else. With the @platform and your personal @sign, you get your own keys to your own datadom, your own micro-server, and a world of lego-style apps where you mix and match them using your @sign to seamlessly move around the internet without being surveilled.

#### @platform
The entire stack of libraries, widgets,services etc. and the underlying infrastructure components all together form the @platform. It is meant to be a robust toolkit for developers who are looking to create applications that are safe, privacy-conscious, and intuitive to those who use them.

#### @protocol
A brand new decentralized internet protocol (and it’s really a protocol as opposed to application-level software) developed by [The @ Company](https://atsign.com) that is paving the way for an internet that values people’s data and privacy before corporate interests—something that we like to call the Alternative Internet.

#### secondary server
