  The fastest way to get going developing with the @platform!
---

We’re excited to help you get your very own @platform environment up and running!

## Prerequisites

You will need Flutter/Dart installed on your machine. If you haven’t already, please follow the “Getting started” steps on [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) before you proceed. Flutter works best with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), but you can also use [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as your IDE. 

### Flutter

Why have we chosen to work with Flutter? That's an easy question to answer! Typically the first thing a developer thinks about when talking about Flutter are the beautiful U.I.'s that can be created! You have the power to control every pixel that exists within your app whilst making your own brand come to life with flawless user experience.

If you've ever tried to compile an application on an emulator before, you already know how long and strenuous that process can be! However, with Flutter, apps directly compile to native ARM code which means insanely fast and efficient project builds that house buttery-smooth animations that allow GPU acceleration. 

In addition to incredibly fast build times, you may have heard of Flutter's 'hot reload' option! This option allows for you to make a quick edit to your code and instead of rebuilding your application time and time again, Flutter will update your source code files and automatically rebuild the widget tree, allowing you to see your edits almost immediatley! 

Just like the rest of the @protocol, Flutter is free and open-source! There are countless numbers of packages that exist on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) that any developer is free to include in their applications. Flutter is a fast-growing community that would love to have you be a part of it! 


### Android Studio
### Intellij
### Visual Studio Code

### Docker Desktop

If you wish to develop with testable, dummy @signs, you will also need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your machine. 

Be sure that your machines operating system is completley up-to-date.
