  The fastest way to get going developing with the @platform!
---

We’re excited to help you get your very own @platform environment up and running!

## Prerequisites

You will need Flutter/Dart installed on your machine. If you haven’t already, please follow the “Getting started” steps on [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) before you proceed. Flutter works best with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), but you can also use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as your IDE. 

If you wish to develop with testable, dummy @signs, you will also need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your machine. 

Be sure that your machines operating system is completley up-to-date.



## Where should I go next?
