# The atsign-foundation

This organization is the home for a number of open source projects and repositories. They generally fall into three basic categories:

1. An open specification for The @protocol.
2. An open source platform implmemtation of the protocol.
3. Documentation, samples and examples of how to use and implement the @platform.

## The @protocol

The @protocol is a new internet protocol which is defined by an open specification document which is maintained in [this](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_protocol) repo.

## The @platform

The @platform is designed to help developers create end-to-end encrypted mobile applications. A full stack platform written in Dart and Flutter, it includes a wide range of libraries, services and widgets specifically designed for creating privacy-first applications on any platform.
