Beyond the fact that this app does a lot more than printing “Hello World!” on the console of your IDE, if you lift its hood, you’ll find a tremendous amount of stuff going on (tracing all the functions called in the server_demo_service.dart file will get you several abstraction layers deep into the @protocol!). By no means do you have to understand everything that is happening behind the scenes in the at_hello_world application, but it’ll definitely help to grasp the basics.\nJust like the rest of the @platform, all of our demo applications are open source! Feel free to download the at_hello_world code from our GitHub repository here!\nUpon downlaoding and booting up the app on an emulator, you are met with the Login screen where you can login after selecting a testable @sign to authenticate with from the dropdown menu.\nAfter successfully authenticating, you will be taken to the home screen where you will see three separate boxes which house the three main functons of the at_hello_world app.\nThe Three Main Functions of the at_hello_world app Update The update section as you may see within the code, actually only involves a single if statement (to ensure information is actually passed!) and four lines of code within it!\n_update() async { if (_key != null \u0026\u0026 _value != null) { AtKey pair = AtKey(); pair.key = _key; pair.sharedWith = atSign; await _serverDemoService.put(pair, _value); } } Above is the entirety of the update function! The “pair” variable in the first line of the if statement is something that you will see in all @platform applications. The @protocol interprets keys as AtKey objects, which have several attributes like “key”, “metadata”, and “sharedBy” that help the backend understand what to do with them.\nIn the code snippet above, we are calling the “key” attribute to add a string that will be paired to a value and the “sharedWith” attribute to define with whom we are sharing this AtKey-value pair. If we’d like to store “hello” and “world” on @bob’s secondary server, we would set pair.key to “hello” and pair.sharedWith to “@bob”. This latter detail may be a bit odd: Bob is sharing this AtKey object with himself so that he can access it! We’ll visit later use cases of sharing AtKey-value pairs with other @signs in the advanced @platform verbs section.\nFollowing up with our “hello” and “world” example, the final step in the _update function is to call the “put” verb from the _serverDemoService object with “pair” as the AtKey instance and “world” as the corresponding value (which should just be a string). When the verb executes successfully, you will have put the “hello” and “world” key-value pair into @bob’s secondary server!\nWhile this is certainly an impressive feat (after all, these few seemingly unassuming lines of code uniquely encrypts the key-value pair to @bob’s secondary server and makes it persist), we’re still limited by the fact that we can’t retrieve key-value pairs from a secondary server. In the @protocol, retrieving key-value pairs takes two steps: scanning the relevant secondary server for AtKey objects, and getting the value associated with a scanned AtKey object.\nScan Now that we’ve “put” information on our secondary, we’d now like to retrieve that key in order to read the information associated with it. In order to display values that we’ve stored, we first need to scan a secondary server for relevant AtKey objects (i.e. those that belong to the “namespace” of the application) and retrieve the values corresponding to those AtKeys.\n_scan() async { List\u003cAtKey\u003e response = await _serverDemoService.getAtKeys( sharedBy: atSign, ); if (response.length \u003e 0) { List\u003cString\u003e scanList = response.map((atKey) =\u003e atKey.key).toList(); setState(() =\u003e _scanItems = scanList); } } The only @protocol verb we’re calling in this snippet is “getAtKeys()”. This verb is an incredibly robust function that can gather and sort AtKeys on a secondary server based on things like who shared those AtKeys (the “sharedBy” optional argument) and regular expressions (e.g. the namespace of the application). Because the at_hello_world app is a special case where we only share AtKey objects with ourselves, we can simply call getAtKeys with the “sharedBy” argument set to our own @sign (i.e. widget.atSign). This will return a List of the AtKey objects we want.\nOnce you get that List of AtKeys, you’re pretty much finished! In the at_hello_world, because we want to display keys as strings, we call the “map” method on the List of AtKeys to create a new list that just contains the “key” attribute of each AtKey object. In the last line of code, we call “setState” so that the app loads the newly populated list of keys in the DropdownButton widget.\nLookup An individual on the at_hello_world app is given a list of keys, and they select one (_lookupKey) to find its corresponding value. How do we do this? The answer lies in the _lookup function of the HomeScreen class:\n_lookup() async { if (_lookupKey != null) { AtKey lookup = AtKey(); lookup.key = _lookupKey; lookup.sharedWith = atSign; String response = await _serverDemoService.get(lookup); if (response != null) { setState(() =\u003e _lookupValue = response); } } } In the first line of the if statement, we are creating a new AtKey object called “lookup.” The reason for this is we need a dummy AtKey object that can be passed into the @protocol for looking up the correct value. For the at_hello_world app, this dummy AtKey just needs its “key” and “sharedWith” attributes populated before it can be passed into the “get” verb.\n(If you think creating a copy of an AtKey object is a hassle, that’s totally valid! In a typical @platform application, you have the _scan and _lookup functions merged to some degree so that you can just pass in the AtKey objects we retrieved with the “getAtKeys” verb to the “get” verb. The point of having two separate functions in the at_hello_world project is to define the “scanning” and “getting” steps more concretely).\n“Get” is a very straightforward verb: it gets the value corresponding to a specified AtKey!\nOnce we retrieve the value paired with the “lookup” AtKey, all that’s left is calling “setState” to display the “_lookupValue” on screen.\n","categories":"","description":"Not sure where to start?

We are looking for contributors to help improve our documentation and especially with language translations.\n We use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and GitHub Actions to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nHere’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\n Fork the atsign.dev repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.)   Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers.  Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n  Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\n  Fork the atsign.dev repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git   Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n  Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the atsign.dev repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources  Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

What does forking a repository mean? What is a pull request? How can you make a contribution?\nWhat is an open source project? For anyone who is new to not just software development but project management in general, an open source project is that of which any person has access to all of the details of the project and are free to utilize it, use it for research purposes, make modifications to it, and even distribute it elsewhere. GitHub of course, being one of the main wellsprings of open source projects! For the sake of this article, I will be using The @ Company’s atsign-foundation  repository to explain any examples.\nWhy would you want to contribute to an open source project? With the new, blossoming field of data science, being capable of finding your way around a GitHub project is a significantly useful skill in today’s world. You’ll find that many corporate entities will highlight your contributions to any GitHub project (as long as you have listed them within your résumé!). You’ll also find that there are many friendly developers who really appreciate the people who add modifications to the project, and especially if that modification comes with a flagged issue (there seems to be a special place in the heart of a developer for people who raise issues within their code)! There’s also this sense of great accomplishment when you can add something useful to a project, more importantly, for the projects that you use often.\nHow can you contribute to an open source project? Choosing a Project: The first step in contributing something to a project is knowing what project you will contribute to! I’d personally recommend thinking about a project or an idea you have familiarity with as this will greatly assist in understanding what the project’s purpose is.\nForking a Repository: What is forking? In simplest terms, forking a project is simply making a copy of it to your own GitHub profile. GitHub allows anyone to fork a repository and this will allow you to do whatever you please with the entire repository without making any actual changes to the real project! Imagine it as taking a picture of a tree. You can make edits to your photo to make the tree look purple or to give it a face, but you won’t make any changes to the actual tree!\nHow to Fork a Repository: First, navigate to the home page of the repository you wish to fork. Refer to the screenshot below:\nHere, you can see that I am currently within the atsign-foundation’s ‘at_demos’ repository.\nIf you look at the top right corner of the repository’s page, you’ll notice the ‘Fork’ button and a number next to it. That number represents the number of times this specific repository has been forked. Once you select the Fork button, GitHub will prompt you which repository you wish to fork to. My go-to option is typically my own profile, where it will create an entire repository under your profile name so that you may make whatever modifications you wish. After you choose what location you wish to fork to, GitHub will do all of the hard work for you. After a few seconds or so (depending on your Internet connection speed), you’ll find that the entire repository that you forked, is now copied to wherever you told GitHub to fork it! Congratulations! You’ve forked a repository!\nMake Modifications to the Repository: Now, you can do whatever your heart so desires with the project! Depending on what the project is, you may wish to clone the repository to your local machine using https/, or simply commit changes directly on your forked repository (totally your choice/preference!).\nCreating a Public Key with GitHub We recommend git cloning the repository using the SSH key option. You can set up your own public keys on GitHub quite easily. If you see below, you will see the Clone options, ‘HTTPS, SSH, and GitHub CLI’. Select the ‘SSH’ option and this will provide you a password-protected SSH key to git clone the repository.\nIn order to create a public key on your machine, open any UNIX terminal and type the command:\nssh-keygen From here, it will ask you to choose a lcoation to store the key. We suggest just clicking ‘enter’ on whatever location is chosen for you. It will then ask for a passphrase, we STRONGLY recommend clicking ‘enter’ again to not input a passphrase. After doing this, it will ask you to input the passphrase again and click ‘enter’ without inputting anything. After having successully creating the key, enter the command:\ncat ~\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub This will print out your public key. Copy the entire thing, including the ssh in the beginning and whatever the final character is and navigate to your GitHub settings page. Within your settings, you will see a tab titled, ‘SSH and GPG keys’. Once you navigate to this page, you should see a green bottom near the top-left titled, ‘New SSH key’. Once you have clciked this and navigated to the new SSH Key page, you will have to input a name for the key as well as pasting the retrieved key copied from the above command. After you have done both of these things, you can finish with the ‘Add SSH key’ button and you will now be able to git clone in your terminal with the SSH URL.\nCreate a Pull Request: After you are satisfied with the changes you have made to the project and are confident that this change will be beneficial to include, all you now have to do is create a pull request within the project’s real repository. GitHub has made it very simple to create a pull request for comparing forks. Refer to the screenshot below:\nYou may notice, in the top left corner of the repository, you will see the ‘Pull requests’ option. After selecting this, you will be taken to the Pull Requests page. This page will show you every pull request that has been created for the specific repository. If you see below, there has been one pull request for this repository thus far.\nIf you are sure you are ready to create a new pull request, simply click the ‘New pull request’ button. This will then navigate you to the compare page. If you followed the above steps, you would want to ‘compare forks’, which will be a small hyperlink as circled below:\nThis will now change the base and head repositories that will be compared. Be sure to select the correct branch of the real project that you wish to make a pull request for. Select the same repository you forked and the correct branch as the ‘base’ repository and ‘base’ branch. You may need to contact the project leader or one of the main developers if you need assistance for which branch you need to make a pull request for. After selecting these, be very careful in selecting the repository that you forked. This will be where you had made the modifications. Select this repository as the ‘head’ repository and ‘compare’ branch.\nFrom here, you will see all of the modifications that will occur if your pull request is accepted. Once you double check all of these modifications and are confident in it, you may now select ‘Create pull request’. You may notice that mine says ‘View pull request’ but that is because I have already gone through this process and have successfully created one.\nSide note: Be sure that your contribution will be useful for those who utilize the project! If you do end up creating a pull request with your modifications, make sure that those modifications are properly documented in both the code and/or the comment section of the pull request itself.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Contributing to an Open-Source GitHub Project Overview: There are a …","ref":"/guides/contributing-open-source-proj/","tags":"","title":""},{"body":"Working With Hugo (Static Webpage Generator) Overview: Hugo, an open-source static website generator, is a new way to create web pages easily with flexible thematic capabilities. How do you get started with it and how can you go from beginner to confident?\nWhat is Hugo? Hugo is a static site generator that can be seen as a competitor for WordPress and Bootstrap. The best part about Hugo that differentiates it from its competitors is that it is an open-source project, which means it’s free to use! Hugo also makes content management a headache-free, comprehensive process! Hugo can be incredible for this type of content management due to not even needing to write HTML if web development is not something you’re comfortable with! If you are the type who really enjoys getting your hands dirty, Hugo’s flexibility expands to allowing developers to completely modify everything about their own static web page. Now what’s a static web page? You can pretty much sum it up to be a hard-coded page of information that, of course, does not change dynamically. The best advantage that static web pages have over dynamic web pages is the extreme difference in speed. Because most dynamic websites are producing content for the individual visitor, it can take much longer to produce the content.\nThere’s a growing community behind Hugo with numerous Stack Overflow locations with any questions relevant to that of Hugo. Getting Started with Hugo:\nWindows: Installing Hugo on Windows: There are a few ways in which you can get started with Hugo, however the easiest way I have found to getting started and jumping straight into things is by the following steps:\nCreate a directory in a location on your drive. For me, I have more storage capacity within my D: drive so I navigate to my D: drive within my File Explorer and simply right click and select ‘Folder’. This will create a new folder wherever you were within your drive. Next, rename this folder to ‘Hugo’. After this, navigate inside of your Hugo folder and create another folder within it, this time calling it ‘bin’.\nYou’re now ready to download Hugo on to your machine. As most projects which are open-source can be found on GitHub, so can Hugo’s releases. In any web browser, navigate to the GoHugoIo repository. Here, you will find a great list of all of the releases catered for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Be sure to select a release that has your operating system in the title. For example, I am using a Windows 10 machine that runs a 64 bit processor. So I navigated to the zip file titled hugo_extended_0.83.1_Windows-64bit.zip. (Note: the release number may be different from the one listed above due to the time at which I have written this document. You may also noticed that I have chosen the extended Hugo version. Hugo extended has more capabilities, especially for thematic purposes. Hugo’s extension comes with a few advantages such as; SASS/SCSS support, Minify javascript and css, resource catenation, source mapping, image processing and so much more. A more in depth view of it can be found here.\nOnce you have found the matching release title for your machine, feel free to simply download the zip file. Where you download the zip file does not matter, however, where you extract it does. When your download is complete, select ‘Extract all’ and be sure that you extract the contents of what you downloaded into the ‘bin’ folder that exists within your Hugo folder. Once the extraction is complete, it should look something like this:\nFor the release that I have downloaded and extracted, there are three files. Perhaps in a later release of Hugo, there may be more files included, but for now, as long as you have the application file titled ‘hugo’, you will be fine. If, for whatever odd reason, the ‘hugo’ file is titled something else, be sure to rename it to ‘hugo’ (note the lowercase ‘h’). There is also a license file and a readme. It is completely up to you if you read the readme and license files.\nDetermining if your Installation on Windows was successful:\nApologies in advance for MacOS and Linux users as I will be demonstrating the following steps using a Windows 10 machine. A later edit with both MacOS and Linux will be created to cater those who wish to learn from a separate operating system. To make sure that your Hugo was successfully installed and extracted, open your command prompt [Some ways in which this can be done =\u003e (Win key + r, type ‘cmd’, hit ‘enter’), (Go to your Search bar and the bottom of your taskbar and type in ‘cmd’ or ‘command prompt’ and hit ‘enter’)] and navigate to the directory where you extracted Hugo. For the above picture, my hugo.exe file’s location was D:\\Hugo\\bin\\hugo.exe, so all I have to type is ‘cd D:\\Hugo\\bin’ and I will be taken to where the hugo.exe exists. If you’re not sure where you had saved your Hugo folder, you can either use the File Explorer you have presently open and simply highlight the path that is in the bar above your currently open Hugo folder. I have circled it below for your convenience.\nTo show what your command prompt should look like: Once you are here, feel free to try the command ‘hugo version’: If your command prompt happily prints out the current version of Hugo you have on your machine, this means you have successfully installed and extracted Hugo onto your machine. However, you may notice that if you use the command ‘cd ..’ to move directories to the ‘Hugo’ folder rather than ‘bin’ and try the command ‘hugo version’ you will be hit with an error or Windows will tell you that hugo isn’t a recognized command. If you are like me, and wish to be capable of using the hugo command anywhere on your machine, maybe because you would like to create a web page with its own folder and its own content, there is an easy way to fix this.\nWhat you will have to do is navigate to your ‘Search’ bar and type in ‘env’ or ‘environment’. Windows will suggest the ‘Edit the System Environment Variables’. Open it and a System Properties dialog box should appear and look something like this: Double-click on the button labeled ‘Environment Variables’ and this will open the dialog box where you can edit the environment variables of your machine. You may be wondering what environment variables are and what they’re for. In simplest terms, just like how you noticed that your hugo command did not work outside of the bin folder, there are other applications that work the same way and will only work in the folder they exist in. Windows has the capability of allowing you to run the application from anywhere, which is exactly what we would like to do. You should see something in your ‘user variables’ called Path. Each Path that is listed, is more than likely an application, similar to your Hugo, that exists only in a folder but is used globally on your machine. Highlight ‘Path’ and click ‘Edit…’. This will open a new dialog box that will list the individual paths that already exist. Click ‘New’ and simply type (or paste) the location of your hugo.exe. If you may recall from my example, my hugo.exe was in the following location; D:\\hugo_ext\\bin.\nHere’s what mine looks like after I have finished typing in where it exists (it is the one highlighted in blue). After you have done the same, you can now click ‘OK’ until all of the dialog boxes are closed. Now this is where the magic happens! After restarting your computer, try using the ‘hugo version’ command again outside of the ‘Hugo\\bin’ folder and see if Windows recognizes it as a command! I simply started up my command prompt and immediately typed in ‘hugo version’ and it worked. If the command works, you are now ready to get started on a Hugo project.\nMac: Installing Hugo on Mac: The first step you will want to take is navigating to the website Homebrew. This website is a package manager and allows you to install, download and manage packages. You can use Homebrew to install Hugo easily on your computer. Once you are taken to the landing page, you should come across a terminal command that looks like:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" // NOTE: // This command may be updated depending on any new releases, // so be sure to check the website before copying the line of code above!\nSimply paste the line of code into your terminal. Once you click enter and input your password for administrative access, Homebrew will begin installing itself onto your machine. This can take a few minutes.\tOnce Homebrew is finished, you can then type the command:\nbrew install hugo Homebrew may update itself automatically before installing hugo.\nDetermining if your Installation on Windows was successful: You can validate your install by the command:\nwhich hugo You can also use the command:\nhugo version If you run into an error, proceed through the Windows steps and follow the instructions up until the GitHub section where you manually install the package from the repository for your own machine.\nCreating a Hugo project: Depending on your operating system, open your command prompt/terminal. You can also launch an IDE of your preference and have the terminal open within it. To create a new hugo project, be sure that you are within a directory that you would want to have your Hugo project created in. For this article, I will create a new folder within my D: drive (Windows) and then use the command:\nhugo new site your_name_here Refer to the steps within my command prompt below: I first check that my hugo command works, change directory into my D: drive, create a new folder called, ‘my_hugo_site’, navigate into that folder, and then create a new Hugo site called, ‘my_hugo_project’.\nIf you receive the ‘Congratulations!’ message, this means that you have successfully created a new Hugo site. If you expand the project folder to see its contents, you will see that a few folders have been created. (Be sure that you navigate within your newly created project first!)\nThe number of folders created here may seem a bit overwhelming, but have no fear! We will go over what each folder is for.\nArchetypes: The first folder is the ‘archetypes’ folder. This folder is typically used by those more confident with Hugo. An archetype, in its simplest form, is simply a constant that occurs throughout all of the content of your website, something that will not change. With Hugo, you can manually create data about your site (for you Computer Scientists, that’s metadata!). What this means is that you can assign values to things that will not be changing. This could mean, who initially created the website, what date it was created, what information populates the site itself, and etc.\nContent: A very self explanatory folder, this is where the main content of your site will exist.\nData: You can almost view this as your website’s own database which can house .json files and allows you to utilize information that exists within external pieces.\nLayouts: Just like a word document, if you wish to add information within the same location of every page that exists on your website, such as a header or a footer, this is where you would add that.\nStatic: This is, of course, where your static elements will exist. These elements may include your javascript or css files.\nconfig.toml: This file contains the settings of your website, such as its URL, what language it contains, and the title of the website.\nThemes: If graphic design isn’t one of your strengths, Hugo being an open-source project means that there are countless persons releasing their own themes and layouts for you to use! You can browse these themes here. Installing a theme is just as simple as downloading a folder to your machine, because that is exactly what you are doing! You may notice that every theme which peaks your interest will also exist on GitHub. You can use whatever method you prefer to retrieve the code. In this document, I will demonstrate a couple ways to do this. Once you find a theme that suits your needs or ‘aesthetic’, simply click on the theme. You may see two or three buttons, ‘Download’, ‘Demo’, ‘Homepage’. If you are confident that this is the theme you want, click ‘Download’ and it will take you to the GitHub repository where the theme exists. Click on the green ‘Code’ button and this will give you a few options on how to retrieve the code.\nFor this example, I have found a theme that interests me titled ‘Dream’. For users who have Git, you can copy the https link and navigate into the ‘themes’ folder of your project to git clone it. Refer to the screenshot below (I am using Git Bash):\nWhen you clone the repository, it will automatically create a folder for you. However, if you are not sure how to use Git, you can simply download the Zip file onto your machine. Before installing this zip folder, be sure to create a folder within your ‘themes’ folder with the appropriate title of the theme you are downloading. After downloading the zip folder, you should extract the contents into the folder that you just created inside of your ‘themes’ folder. You can see in the screenshot below, that the folder ‘hugo-theme-dream’ exists within the ‘themes’ folder.\nAfter successfully implementing the above steps, navigate into your config.toml file and add the line of code below everything else that exists in the file:\ntheme = “folder_name_here” So, in my case, I would type the following:\ntheme = “hugo-theme-dream” After adding this line, save the document and to make sure that you have properly called this theme into your site use the following command in your command prompt/terminal to start up your Hugo local server:\nhugo server -D The -D will launch all of the draft pages that exist within your project folder.\nAfter this, you can now open any web browser and type in the URL:\nlocalhost:1313\nYou should now see your website and the theme you installed!
